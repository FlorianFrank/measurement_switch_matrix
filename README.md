### 1. Circuit description 

The circuit is subdivided into two parts, a **control part** and a measurement part. 
The measurement part consists of a 12 V power supply forwarded to four darlington arrays (ULN2003APW), which are responsible
for switching the Finder 40.41 relays. Single lines on the darlington arrays are controlled by two 2/16 ADG726 multiplexers. 
The multiplexer transform a four bit input address signal to a parallel output signal which selects a specific row and column relay
over the Darlington arrays. The multiplexers are controlled by a Arduino Nano.

The measurement part consists of four BNC connectors I_D, V_DS, V_GS and GND.
V_DS connects is forwarded to each CNT_FETs on the matrix not switched. 
I_D is forwarded to the selected row.
GND is forwarded to the selected column.
V_GS is connected to the global gate.

### 2. Connecting the board

#### 2.1 Connect the Arduino Nano 

Connect the Arduino Nano to the NanoSEC Switch Matrix like shown in the following picture.
Use a Micro USB cable to connect the arduino to the computer. The Arduino is working if the green 
'ON' led is green. If the Arduino was flashed once the firmware is automatically restarted on the device
when it's connected to the power supply of the computer. The Arduino should show up in the device manager. 
On linux the device should be registered as '/dev/ttyUSB0'.

![Arduino Connection](documentation/figures/Arduino_Connection.jpg)


#### 2.2 Connect the Power Supply

A DC power supply must be connected to drive the relays. The power supply can be connected by the barrel jack connector
on the left buttom of the board or by connecting jumper cables to the power supply pins below the barrel jack connector.

![Connector DC Power Supply](documentation/figures/Connectors_DC_Powersupply.jpg)

Please check the maximum ratings like described in the following table.

|   Unit       | Minimum | Maximum  |
|:------------:|:--------|:--------:|
| Voltage      |   12    |       12 |
| Current      | 83mA    |    500mA |

When two relays are switched a current of 83mA can be observed on a DC power supply like shown in the subsequent figure.


![Connector DC Power Supply](documentation/figures/DC_Powersupply.jpg)


#### 2.3 Jumpers 

The board contains several Jumpers for debugging purposes or to execute differnt types of measurements. 
  
  TODO add jumper descriptions.



### 3. Setup and Production

The code is basically subdivided into two different components. 
- The **Arduino Firmware** which is the code executed on the Arduino Nano. 
It accepts commands via an UART interface and forwards the commands to the multiplexers, which switch the corresponding rows and columns.
  <br><br>
- The **Client Side API** is executed on the computer responsible for the test execution and communicates the 
commands to the Arduino Nano via an UART interface.
  
#### 3.1 Preconditions
  
##### 3.1.1 Install git
  
 On Windows: 
  ```
  Follow the link:
  https://git-scm.com/download/win
  And install the executable.
  ```
 On Linux:
  ```
  # apt-get install git
  ```
  
#### 3.1.2 Clone the directory
  
  ```
$ git clone https://github.com/FlorianFrank/measurement_switch_matrix.git
Cloning into 'measurement_switch_matrix'...
Username for 'https://github.com': test
Password for 'https://test@github.com': test123
  ```
##### 3.1.3 Update on changes
  
 ```
  $ git pull
 ```
  
  Updates the current working copy to the current version on the repo.

##### 3.1.1 Install the avr-gcc compiler

First hte avr-gcc compiler must be installed. Therefore, go to **Arduino_Firmware/Toolchain/SysGCC** and execute **avr-gcc5.3.0.exe
.** You see an installation dialog. Like shown the in the figure below. Select the Arduino_firmware/Toolchain/ directory and install the compiler.

![Connector DC Power Supply](documentation/figures/Install_Compiler.png)

##### 3.1.2 Further tools

Further tools like cmake and ninja are already included in the repository in the Toolchain folder and do not have to be installed
manually. 

##### 3.1.3 Compiling AVRDude

We are using AVRDude to flash the firmware image on the Arduino Nano. 
You can find the installation under Toolchain/AVRDude. 

On Windows: 
<br>
There is alredy a precompiled version under AVRDude/bin/Win32 so the files don't need to be compiled

On Linux: 
<br>
Go to AVRDude and run: 
```
./compile_linux.sh
```

Afterwareds you will find the avr compilation under bin/amd64.

#### 3.2 Look up the COM Port

Press the windows button on the keyboard and go to the device manager. The device should be listed as **"USB Serial Port (COM[ID])".**
In a next step adjust the settings.cmake.

![COMPort](documentation/figures/Device_Manager.png)

##### 3.3 Setting CMAKE settings

In the Arduino_Firmware folder you can find a settings.cmake file.  
These contain the most important properties of the firmware. 
To build and flash the Arduino firmware. Only the USB_Port must be adjusted. You can check out the correct
'COM' port in the device manager.

```
option(BUILD_DOCUMENTATION "BUILD_DOCUMENTATION" OFF)
option(ARDUINO_NANO_OLD "BUILD for old Arduino Nano Board (blue)" ON)
option(USB_PORT "Set the USB port on Linux /dev/ttyUSB0 on windows COM<comID>" "COM6")
option(ARDUINO_PROGRAMMER "Set the programmer to be used to flash the Arduino Nano" "avrispmkii")

```
When using the old version of the Arduino Nano (blue PCB) the flag ARDUINO_NANO_OLD must be set to ON.

![arduino_new](documentation/figures/arduino_new.jpg)
```
option(ARDUINO_NANO_OLD "BUILD for old Arduino Nano Board (blue)" OFF)
# uses the atmega328 programmer
```

![arduino_old](documentation/figures/arduino_old.jpg)
```
option(ARDUINO_NANO_OLD "BUILD for old Arduino Nano Board (blue)" ON)
# uses the atmega328old programmer
```


When using the old version of the Arduino Nano (blue PCB) the flag ARDUINO_NANO_OLD must be set to ON.
To compile the firmware for the new version (green PCB) this flag must be disabled. 
Set the BUILD_DOCUMENTATION option to automatically build the Code Documentation as HTML and Latex files. 



##### 3.4 Compiling the firmware

On Linux run: 

```
cd ./Arduino_Firmware
./compile.sh
```

On Windows run:

```
cd ./Arduino_Firmware
./compile.bat
```
<br><br>
After comiling you find a folder ./build in the Arduino Firmware directory containing the firmware to be flashed on the Arduino Nano.
The firmware is build sucessfully when you see an output similar to the command line output below:
```
[100%] Linking CXX executable nanosec_crossbar_controller.elf
Generating EEP image
Generating HEX image
Calculating image size
Firmware Size:  [Program: 8186 bytes (25.0%)]  [Data: 641 bytes (31.3%)] on atmega328p
EEPROM   Size:  [Program: 0 bytes (0.0%)]  [Data: 0 bytes (0.0%)] on atmega328p

[100%] Built target nanosec_crossbar_controller
```



##### 3.5 Flashing the Firmware onto the Arduino Nano

On Linux run after compiling:

```
cd ./Arduino_Firmware
./flash.sh
```


On Windows after compiling:

```
cd ./Arduino_Firmware
./flash.bat
```

fterwards you should see following output:

### 3. Communication Protocol

A lightweight communication protocol is implemented on the Arduino Nano tunneled over the USB UART interface.
A UART connection is established by simply plugin in the Mini USB cable. On linux for example, the device is 
typically available under "/dev/ttyUSB0" on Windows the device can be seen in the device manager under "COMxx".

#### 3.1 UART properties 

|     Properties     | Values |
|:--------------:|:-----------:|
| Baudrate            | 115200  |
| Data bits           | 8  |
| Stop Bits           | 8  |
| Parity              | None  |
| Flow control        | None  |

##### 3.2 Commands

|     Command     | Description | Allowed values |
|:--------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| connect            | Connect to the Arduino controller  | - |
| disconnect            | Disconnect the connection  | - |
| r:           | Select a row | 1- 12  |
| c:           | Select a column | 1- 12  |
| ack           | Command was acknowledged by the Arduino controller | -  |
| error:           | Error code returned by the Arduino controller |  Any error message |

Sample accessing the protocol on linux: 
```shell
$ serial /dev/ttyUSB0
$ connect
-> ack
$ r: 1
 ack
$ c: 1
 ack

$ column: 15
 error: Invalid index

$ disconnect
 ack
```

### 4 Python Tester

In the folder python_tester you can find a python test application, which switches all relays 
in an infinite loop. 

##### 4.1 Installation

- On Windows: 
  - Install Python3 (e.g. 3.10.2) from the [official home page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  - Install pyserial from the [official home page](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/#files)

- On Linux
  ```shell
  # Install python3
  $ sudo apt-get install python3
  $ sudo apt-get install pip3
  $ sudo pip install pyserial
  ```

##### 4.2 Execution

  To run the program execute following command.
  Thereby <serial_port> must be replaced with the actual port to which the Arduino is connected. 
  On Linux this is typically /dev/ttyUSB0 on Windows computers you can look up the port in the device manager. 


  ```shell
  $ python3 switch_matrix_tester.py "<serial_port>"
  ```
